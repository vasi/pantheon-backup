# Adjacent to this is the folder in /var/shared/assets where they will be backed up to
# Write in the alias starting with the @ sign. To view all available aliases run 'drush sa'
# We separate the alias and the folder it is placed in using a colon
# if the folder does not exist it will automatically be created
